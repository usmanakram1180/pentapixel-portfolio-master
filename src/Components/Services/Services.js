                                Most of the traffic comes from the first 3-5 positions in the SERP. Therefore, we increase the visibility of the application in the search results: we conduct text optimization taking into account the features of the store and their ranking algorithms. To increase the conversion to the installation, we work on the icon and screenshots to make the application more attractive to users.</p>
