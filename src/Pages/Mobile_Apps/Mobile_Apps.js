                <h3>HOW LONG IS THE APP PUBLISHED?</h3>
                <p>After the creation of the software is completed, the moment of truth comes - the publication in the store. Publication depends on the peculiarities of moderation on the platforms. The Play Market reviews products faster than the App Store. On average, moderation lasts from several days to several weeks. In this case, the software will already be published.</p>
